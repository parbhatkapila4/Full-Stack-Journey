# Full Stack Web Development Journey (Week-by-Week)

This repo tracks my personal journey learning full stack web development — starting with core web fundamentals and moving up to modern full stack tools like Next.js, TypeScript, WebSockets, and PostgreSQL with Prisma. It’s organized week by week, covering what I learned, built, and explored along the way.



## Tech Stack & Tools

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM
- React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- Next.js

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express.js
- WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma

**Design / UI/UX**
- Figma for wireframing and prototyping
- Responsive and accessible UI design

**Dev Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- Postman, MongoDB Compass, VS Code
- Netlify, Vercel, Render



## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1–2: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Basics
- Built responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid
- Learned JS fundamentals: variables, functions, events, loops
- Mini projects: quiz app, calculator, form validation

### Week 3: DOM Manipulation
- Selecting and modifying DOM elements
- Event delegation, dynamic content updates
- Interactive UI features (modals, tabs, sliders)

### Week 4–8: Backend Fundamentals (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
- Learned how the web works: HTTP, REST, APIs
- Built REST APIs with Express
- CRUD operations with MongoDB + Mongoose
- Used Postman to test endpoints
- First full stack app with frontend-backend integration

### Week 9–11: React
- Components, props, state, useEffect
- React Router for page navigation
- React project: task manager with login/authentication

### Week 12: UI/UX and Figma
- Designed wireframes and mockups in Figma
- Focused on layout hierarchy, spacing, and visual consistency
- Converted Figma designs into responsive HTML/CSS/React

### Week 13: Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- Responsive layouts, custom themes, dark mode
- Rebuilt older projects using Tailwind for cleaner code

### Week 14–15: TypeScript
- Added types to JavaScript: variables, functions, components
- React + TypeScript projects
- Backend type safety with Express

### Week 16: WebSockets
- Real-time communication with Socket.IO
- Chat application and notification system
- Learned difference between HTTP and WebSocket protocols

### Week 17–18: PostgreSQL, SQL, Prisma
- Learned relational databases: tables, queries, joins
- Created schemas using Prisma ORM
- Full stack app using PostgreSQL + Prisma + Express

### Week 19–21: Next.js
- File-based routing, dynamic pages, API routes
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Generation)
- Full stack app: blog platform with markdown content and database integration
- Deployment with Vercel
